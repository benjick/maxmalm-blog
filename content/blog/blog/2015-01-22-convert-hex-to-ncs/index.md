> ðŸš¨ **Update 2023-10-15:** I've built a new service for this, seeing as this blog post still brings trafic, find it at https://converthex.to/ncs. Do you need paid API access? Email me at benjick@dumfan.net and we can discuss something.

Yesterday I created a simple API to get the closest NCS of a hex triplet (and then the hex triplet of that NCS). I later expanded it into a site where you can use the API without implementing it yourself and see the color it locates.

You can find the site at http://code.maxmalm.se/ncs/

Yes, I know the image refers to the Pantone color chart instead of NCS.

The site uses Kimono Labs and Encycolorpedia to serve you this data.
